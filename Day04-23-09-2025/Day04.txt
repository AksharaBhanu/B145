every day code /notes/image--> https://github.com/aksharaBhanu/B145

print--> function--> it prints the given input on the console
input is called as--> arguments - we can send any number of arguments ,
variable--> memory container used to store some info
in python we do not declare a variable 

int i; declaring i as a variable of type integer (numeric)
i=100;  --> initializing i with the value 100

in python we do not write --> int i XXXXX
we directly write i=100

int i;i=100;print(i);  --> 3 statements in 1 line --> this is not possible python
in python 1 line --> 1 statement
we do not use ;

while writing the code we can have blank lines 
but we cant give space and start the code
code must start at the beginning of the line

any name given by python user (u and me) are called as identifier 
rule to specify identifier
1. no keywords 
https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#keywords
in python we have 35 keywords
False      await      else       import     pass
None       break      except     in         raise
True       class      finally    is         return
and        continue   for        lambda     try
as         def        from       nonlocal   while
assert     del        global     not        with
async      elif       if         or         yield


2. it can contain only a-z A-Z 0-9 _
any upper/lowercase letter or any digit and _ 

 Note: space is not allowed special char other than _ are not allowed


3. it should NOT start with digit 
  it can start with letter or _

4. name is case sensitive

5. no max limit on identifier name length 


in python there is NO constant 

we specify variable name in CAPS to indicate not to change it
ex:
MAX=100
PI=3.142
