DataTypes--> Type of data stored in a variable
in python variable we can store any kind of data
type(variable)

int float complex
NoneType
bool
str
list tuple range
set frozenset
dict
bytes

operations --> operators --> operand

print(a+b)
operation: addition
operator: +
operands a & b

arithmetic operators
+ addition
- subtraction
* multiplication
/ division
// floor division
** exponentiation (power of)
% modulus 

when we have more than one operator in a given expression ,execution happens based on operator operator precedence and not from left to right


BODMAS
PEMDAS

B --> ()
O--> order **
D--> Division
M--> multiplication
A-->addition
S--> subtraction

P--> ()
E--> Exp
M --> Mul
D--> Div
A--> add
S--> sub

B

--> **
--> * / // %  (left to right)
--> + - (left to right)
--------------------------------------------
assignment operator
=
+=
-=
*=
/=
//=
%=
**=

Note:
in python when we use +
if both the inputs are number it will do addition
if both the inputs are string it will do concatenation
if one is number and another one is string we get error
we can convert number into string using str()

in python when we use *
if both the inputs are number it will do multiplication
if one is String and another one is number  it will repetition
if both the inputs are string it will throw error

to take input from user during runtime we use input function
but it always returns the given input in string format
